   Before entering middle school, my family lived within the community at the end of a small alley in the center of Xi'an. Near my house is the city walls and moat. The surrounding buildings were modeled after the ancient architecture. As you know, the gray style and the retro environment made me feel very peaceful. Although the life was not bad, the house was so small that I moved outside the walls after entering high school . The new house was huge and full of modern style.Before moving，I lived in Beilin District which next to the Xingqing Park and there were many trees that make me comfortable. Now in the XinCheng area which next to the city government，traffic has become more and more crowded and  noisy. While become more modern ,I also feel annoyed with the noise.
在我上初中之前，我家住在西安市的中心内的一个小的巷子尽头的社区内。我家附近就是城墙和护城河。周围的建筑都是仿照古建筑。正如你所知道的，灰色的风格和复古的居住环境让我觉得很安宁。虽然生活过的还算不错，但是房子太小了，所以上了初中之后，我搬家到了城墙外。新家的楼很高，充满了现代风格。之前是住在碑林区，旁边是兴庆公园，有很多树，让我舒适。现在是在新城区，旁边是市政府。交通变得越来越拥挤且吵闹。在变得更现代化的同时，我也为噪音而感到烦躁。
